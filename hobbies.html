    <p>Vinyl record collecting is a newer activity in my life that during the past few years I have explored thoroughly. As soon as I began collecting LPs I became very interested in listening to albums and exploring new music.</p>

    <p>After visiting Japan in 2019, I decided to learn Japanese. Through self-study and classes I have begun learning the language. I am still at a beginner level because I stopped studying for a while, but currently I am continuing my studies.</p>

    <h2>Videogames</h2>

    <p>I have played videogames for years, but my favorite are Destiny and Destiny 2. There is no game quite like this franchise and whenever I play I enjoy it unlike anything else.</p>
